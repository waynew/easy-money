# Goal Naming

**Status**:  Implemented

## Context

We have a couple of options when it comes to goals. Either a goal is an
individual unit or a goal is simply a name in the account. The implications of
having the goal simply be a name is that we can just use the name to refer to
the goal - otherwise we need to retain an alternate identifier for the goal.

For instance, the following:

- Birthday - $100
- Birthday - $50
- Birthday - $5

This is one option. We would require an identifier, so really it might be like:

- ID: 1 - Birthday - $100
- ID: 2 - Birthday - $50
- ID: 3 - Birthday - $5

That complicates things in the codebase, and also makes it easy to confuse
things for the user, without any real benefit.

## Decision

We will require unique goal names.

## Consequences

It will be impossible to have two goals with the same name, so if users would
like to re-use a name for goals they will have to add their own distinguishing
features, e.g.

- Birthday 2023 - $100
- Birthday 2022 - $50
- Birthday 2021 - $5
